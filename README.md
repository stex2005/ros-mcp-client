The **ROS MCP Client** is a reference implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client, designed to connect directly with [ros-mcp-server](https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-server/).

Instead of using a Desktop LLM client, it acts as a bridge that integrates an LLM, enabling natural-language interaction with any ROS or ROS2 robot.

## üß† What It Does

`ros-mcp-client` implements the LLM-side of the MCP protocol.

It can:
- Connect to a `ros-mcp-server` over MCP (stdio or HTTP).
- Send natural language queries or structured requests to the robot without the need to integrate it with a Desktop LLM client
- Stream back feedback, sensor data, or responses from the server.
- Integrate with a local LLM (Gemini, Ollama, Nvidia NeMo).

In short, it lets you run an MCP-compatible client that speaks to robots via the MCP interface ‚Äî useful for testing, local reasoning, or autonomous AI controllers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features of the ROS MCP Client

- Implements MCP client specification ‚Äî plug-and-play with the ROS MCP server.

- ROS-aware LLM interface ‚Äî specialized prompts and handlers for robotics tasks.

- Supports bidirectional streaming ‚Äî send commands, receive real-time topic feedback.

- LLM integration ready ‚Äî use Gemini, Anthropic, or Ollama APIs as reasoning engines.

- Offline-capable ‚Äî works entirely within local or LAN environments.

## üõ† Getting Started  

The MCP client is version-agnostic (ROS1 or ROS2).

### Prerequisites

- ROS or ROS2 running with `rosbridge`
- Active [`ros-mcp-server`](https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-server) instance

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-client.git
cd ros-mcp-client
```

2. Install `uv` and `rosbridge`  

3. Prepare environment
```
uv sync # or pip install -e
```

4. Pick your model and run the client
```
cd gemini_client
uv run client.py
```

5. Start `rosbridge` on the target robot
